                    <p> My name is April Santana. I am a sophomore majoring in Magazine, News, and Digital Journalism and political science. I am also in the Honors College. I chose syracuse because of the great journalism program. I fell in love with campus when I toured my junior year of high school - April 5,2019 - and I instantly knew that I had to go here.</p>

                    <p>Campus life is definitely a lot different than I expected. The work is not necessarily hard. I went to a magnet high school and I was in the law and justice major which was the hardest major at my school (the business kids would disagree but they don't count). The hardest part has been meeting people and getting involved on campus. </p>

        <strong>April's first semester</strong> My first semester at Syracuse went well despite being mostly online and there being a constant threat of going home. At this point Syracuse was following the 100 case model and in order to not get shut down/ get put completely online we had to be under 100 cases. This was really stressful because as the weather turned colder and cases began to rise, it was basically an eternal loop of anxiety. I did enjoy my first semester because I made really close friends who also lived in the same dorm as me. We went home right before thanksgiving and were home until February.

        <strong>April's second semester</strong> My second semester started off well and then took a turn. My roommate decided to move out. This made the semester harder because I was alone in my room all the time. Many tears were shed and I decided to join a dance group, Raices, to meet new people. It was a really fun experience and I got to partake in my hispanic culture while interacting with other likeminded individuals who joined to form a community while at a PWI. This semester we no longer relied on the 100 case-shut-down method. I think it had to be 5% of the university at this point which was more reastic in a univeristy of this size. We also had to get tested twice a week which was beneficial but also annoying because they'd cut off your access to blackboard/ wifi if you didn't get tested. It was fun overall.

        <strong>April's third semester</strong> This semester has been very rough. I kind of have forgotten how to be a student and how to study. I no longer have the same attention span as I did pre-Covid. I had to quit my dance group because I had a leadership position and it was too much to handle. They combined 3 posiitons into one - creative concept chair - and forced me to prioritze them over school lol so I quit. This semester has also been stressful because I have to be in person all the time. I have to take in person exams which I forgot how to do and its been a very anxiety-inducing semester. I also wanted to join a newspaper on campus but I wasn't able to because of course work and the drastic change to in-person again. There's also the stress of not getting employed after graduation because the job market is decreasing for journalists so I may have to go to law school lol yikes. Overall its been hard and I want to go home.

                    <p> I want to be a journalists because I love the idea of the media being the fourth branch and keeping the other parts of govenrment accountable. I also like how journalists are able to be the connection between corporations/governemnt/officials and the people. We're meant to be that bridge and report on the truth.</p>

                    <p>The class I've enjoyed the most during my semesters here at Syracuse would have to be JNL 211 Cross-Media News Writing. This is the first class I've taken for my major and it reminded me of why I wanted to be a journalists in the first place. Being an MND student among a sea of BDJ kids is very hard because they all tend to have very big personalities and theres just so many of them. This is the one class where I can show my skills and feel that my work has value.</p>
