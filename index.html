		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/" target="_blank">Women's pockets</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-POLLUTION/01008173281/index.html" target="_blank">Pollution in Delhi</a>, Reuters Graphics</li>
			<li><a href="https://egyptbuildingcollapses.org/#" target="_blank">Building collapses in Egypt</a>, <a href="https://alternative-narratives-vis-archive.com/case_studies/egypt-building-collapses" target="_blank">Tactical Technology Collective</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb" target="_blank">COVID deaths through sound</a>, BBC</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<!-- Insert your h3 and p tags, with your text inside, here: --> <h3> Women's Pockets: The Pudding <h3/> 
			<p> The data comes from The Pudding. This is a digital publication that produces data journalism and provides data for various topics. The topics range from the overshadowing of band members after solo careers to the tracking of characters saying the word “cool” in the show community. To gather the data for this story 4 pairs of jeans were measured for every brand mentioned in the story: a skinny and straight style in both men’s and women’s clothing.</p>
				
				<p>The article uses interactive images that change when you scroll to emphasize the disparity between women’s and men’s pant pockets. Some visuals show the size of the pockets based on brand and type. It also includes the price of each pair of jeans. The key message to this dataviz project is showing how women and male jeans are not equal. The pockets in men’s jeans are on average, significantly larger and allow for more things to fit inside. This contributes to an overall societal trend of women’s products not being the same as men’s products.</p>
				
				<p>This data project is visceral because it displays a societal problem that 
				most if not all women experience. Having a lack of pockets affects women and individuals who wear women’s clothing. The different comparisons of pocket sizes made this data project visceral because it emphasized the difference between women’s and men’s clothing.</p>




		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Insert your iframe tag, with your embed code inside, here: --> <p> <<iframe title="US Active-duty Troops worldwide from 1991 to 2020" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-uw8Js" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uw8Js/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="427"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script> </p>

  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
